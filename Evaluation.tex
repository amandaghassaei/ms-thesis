\chapter{Evaluation}\label{chap:evaluation}

Comparison with existing FEA methods revealed a similarity between the cell-cell interaction model I developed in Chapter \ref{chap:functionSim} and a 12DOF Timoshenko Beam Element (Section \ref{sec:Timoshenko}).  My model ignores some Euler-Bernoulli bending components of the Timoshenko model, but also extends Timoshenko with non-linear handling of large angular deformations, rather than using small angle approximations.  I argue that this is an appropriate model given the aspect ratio of the parts I am modeling (Figure \ref{fig:StubbyBeam}) and the expected large angular deformations (Figure \ref{fig:deformationangle}) of flexural joints.  My model showed good qualitative agreement with COMSOL simulations, but more work is needed to run a quantitative analysis.  Performance metrics are explored in Section \ref{sec:performance}.

\section{Comparison with FEA Techniques}\label{sec:Timoshenko}

  \caption{Setup of 12DOF beam model connecting two nodes (nodes 1 and 2).  Translational displacement indicated by $p_x$, $p_y$, $p_z$ and angular displacement indicated by $\theta_x$, $\theta_y$, $\theta_z$.}

\end{figure}

We can perform an analysis of the interactions between two cells using standard techniques from FEA to see how they compare with what we've derived in the previous sections.  Within FEA, many types of models are used to describe the behavior of linear elastic solids with varying degrees of accuracy and computational complexity.  One model that computes translational and rotational degrees of freedom between two nodes is the 12DOF Timoshenko beam.  Using this model, we can construct a beam element between two nodes that represents the material joining two adjacent cells.  The model determines the translational and rotational displacements of both nodes in 3D (Figure \ref{fig:BeamSetup}).  The Timoshenko beam element takes into account axial deformation, bending deformation with shear effects, and torsional deformation.\\  

\textit{Shape functions} are polynomials in 1D, 2D, or 3D that describe how the behavior of the nodes should be interpolated in the regions between the nodes (e.g. the inner volume of the tetrahedron in Figure \ref{fig:TetraElement}).  Hermitian cubic shape functions are typically used for beam models; they are third order polynomials that provide continuity between discretized solutions along nodes in a beam.  A graphical description of shape functions is shown in Wolfram \cite{Wolfram2016}.  The shape functions expressed in terms of a dimensionless coordinate $\xi$ are:
\begin{align*} 
N_{x1} &= \textstyle\frac{1}{4}(1-\xi)^2(2+\xi)\\
N_{x2} &= \textstyle\frac{1}{4}(1+\xi)^2(2-\xi)\\
N_{\theta1} &= \textstyle\frac{1}{8}l(1-\xi)^2(1+\xi)\\
N_{\theta2} &= \textstyle\frac{1}{8}l(1+\xi)^2(1-\xi)
\end{align*}

where $-1 \leq \xi \leq 1$ and $\xi = -1$ at node 1 and $\xi = 1$ at node 2\\

Using these shape functions we can calculate the \textit{stiffness matrix} ($K$) of the 12DOF Timoshenko beam oriented along the x-axis:\\

\[ K =  \scriptsize {\left[ \begin{smallmatrix}
\tfrac{EA}{l} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \tfrac{-EA}{l} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
 & \tfrac{12EI_z}{l^3(1+\phi_y)} & 0 & 0 & 0 & \tfrac{6EI_z}{l^2(1+\phi_y)} & 0 & \tfrac{-12EI_z}{l^3(1+\phi_y)} & 0 & 0 & 0 & \tfrac{6EI_z}{l^2(1+\phi_y)}\\
 &  & \tfrac{12EI_y}{l^3(1+\phi_z)} & 0 & \tfrac{-6EI_y}{l^2(1+\phi_z)} & 0 & 0 & 0 & \tfrac{-12EI_y}{l^3(1+\phi_z)} & 0 & \tfrac{-6EI_y}{l^2(1+\phi_z)} & 0\\
 &  &  &  \tfrac{GJ}{l} &  0 &  0 &  0 &  0 &  0 & \tfrac{-GJ}{l} & 0 & 0\\
 &  &  &  & \tfrac{(4+\phi_z)EI_y}{l(1+\phi_z)} & 0 & 0 & 0 & \tfrac{6EI_y}{l^2(1+\phi_z)} & 0 & \tfrac{(2-\phi_z)EI_y}{l(1+\phi_z)} & 0\\
 &  &  &  &  & \tfrac{(4+\phi_y)EI_z}{l(1+\phi_y)} & 0 & \tfrac{-6EI_z}{l^2(1+\phi_y)} & 0 & 0 & 0 & \tfrac{(2-\phi_y)EI_z}{l(1+\phi_y)}\\
 &  &  &  &  &  & \tfrac{EA}{l}  & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
 &  &  &  &  &  &  & \tfrac{12EI_z}{l^3(1+\phi_y)} & 0 & 0 & 0 & \tfrac{-6EI_z}{l^2(1+\phi_y)}\\
 &  &  &  &  &  &  &  & \tfrac{12EI_y}{l^3(1+\phi_z)} & 0 & \tfrac{6EI_y}{l^2(1+\phi_z)}\ & 0\\
 &  & symmetric &  &  &  &  &  &  & \tfrac{GJ}{l} & 0 & 0\\
 &  &  &  &  &  &  &  &  &  & \tfrac{(4+\phi_z)EI_y}{l(1+\phi_z)} & 0\\
  &  &  &  &  &  &  &  &  &  &  & \tfrac{(4+\phi_y)EI_z}{l(1+\phi_y)}\\
 \end{smallmatrix} \right] }\]
 
 where
\[ \phi_y = \dfrac{12EI_z}{GA_{sy}l^2} \qquad  \textrm{and} \qquad \phi_z = \dfrac{12EI_y}{GA_{sz}l^2} \]


The stiffness matrix gives us a way to convert between translational/rotational nodal displacements and forces, according to the following equation:

 \begin{equation} \label{eq:forcestiffnessdisp} \vec{F} = -K\vec{u} \end{equation}
where:
\[ \vec{F} =  \left[ \begin{array}{ccc}
F_{x1}\\
F_{y1}\\
F_{z1}\\
T_{x1}\\
T_{y1}\\
T_{z1}\\
F_{x2}\\
F_{y2}\\
F_{z2}\\
T_{x2}\\
T_{y2}\\
T_{z2}
 \end{array} \right]  \qquad \qquad  
 \vec{u} =  \left[ \begin{array}{ccc}
p_{x1}\\
p_{y1}\\
p_{z1}\\
\theta_{x1}\\
\theta_{y1}\\
\theta_{z1}\\
p_{x2}\\
p_{y2}\\
p_{z2}\\
\theta_{x2}\\
\theta_{y2}\\
\theta_{z2}
 \end{array} \right]
 \]\\
 
where $F_1$, $F_2$ are translational forces acting on nodes 1 and 2, $T$ are torques, $p$ are translational displacements, and $\theta$ are rotational displacements.  The negative sign was put in front of the stiffness matrix in Equation \ref{eq:forcestiffnessdisp} to keep the same convention of restoring forces used in Chapter \ref{chap:functionSim}.\\

Multiplying through Equation \ref{eq:forcestiffnessdisp} gives us 12 equations:

\begin{subequations}
\begin{align} 
\label{eq:fx1}
F_{x1} &=  -\dfrac{EA}{l}p_{x1} + \dfrac{EA}{l}p_{x2} \\[10pt]
\label{eq:fy1}
F_{y1} &=  -\dfrac{12EI_z}{l^3(1+\phi_y)}p_{y1} - \dfrac{6EI_z}{l^2(1+\phi_y)}\theta_{z1} + \dfrac{12EI_z}{l^3(1+\phi_y)}p_{y2} - \dfrac{6EI_z}{l^2(1+\phi_y)}\theta_{z2}\\[10pt]
\label{eq:fz1}
F_{z1} &=  -\dfrac{12EI_y}{l^3(1+\phi_z)}p_{z1} - \dfrac{6EI_y}{l^2(1+\phi_z)}\theta_{y1} + \dfrac{12EI_y}{l^3(1+\phi_z)}p_{z2} - \dfrac{6EI_y}{l^2(1+\phi_z)}\theta_{y2}\\[10pt]
\label{eq:tx1}
T_{x1} &=  -\dfrac{GJ}{l}\theta_{x1} + \dfrac{GJ}{l}\theta_{x2} \\[10pt]
\label{eq:ty1}
T_{y1} &= \dfrac{6EI_y}{l^2(1+\phi_z)}p_{z1} - \dfrac{(4+\phi_z)EI_y}{l(1+\phi_z)}\theta_{y1}  - \dfrac{6EI_y}{l^2(1+\phi_z)}p_{z2} - \dfrac{(2-\phi_z)EI_y}{l(1+\phi_z)}\theta_{y2} \\[10pt]
\label{eq:tz1}
T_{z1} &=  -\dfrac{6EI_z}{l^2(1+\phi_y)}p_{y1} - \dfrac{(4+\phi_y)EI_z}{l(1+\phi_y)}\theta_{z1}  + \dfrac{6EI_z}{l^2(1+\phi_y)}p_{y2} - \dfrac{(2-\phi_y)EI_z}{l(1+\phi_y)}\theta_{z2} \\[10pt]
\label{eq:fx2}
F_{x2} &=  -F_{x1}\\[10pt]
\label{eq:fy2}
F_{y2} &=  -F_{y1}\\[10pt]
\label{eq:fz2}
F_{z2} &=  -F_{z1}\\[10pt]
\label{eq:tx2}
T_{x2} &=  -T_{x1}\\[10pt]
\label{eq:ty2}
T_{y2} &=  \dfrac{6EI_y}{l^2(1+\phi_z)}p_{z1} - \dfrac{(2-\phi_z)EI_y}{l(1+\phi_z)}\theta_{y1}  - \dfrac{6EI_y}{l^2(1+\phi_z)}p_{z2} - \dfrac{(4+\phi_z)EI_y}{l(1+\phi_z)}\theta_{y2} \\[10pt]
\label{eq:tz2}
T_{z2} &= -\dfrac{6EI_z}{l^2(1+\phi_y)}p_{y1} - \dfrac{(2-\phi_y)EI_z}{l(1+\phi_y)}\theta_{z1}  + \dfrac{6EI_z}{l^2(1+\phi_y)}p_{y2} - \dfrac{(4+\phi_y)EI_z}{l(1+\phi_y)}\theta_{z2}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}\\

Combining Equations \ref{eq:fx1} and \ref{eq:kaxial} gives us the x-axis spring component of Equation \ref{eq:translationalEqOpp}, assuming no relative rotation between the nodes:
\[F_{x1} =  k_{axial_x}(p_{x2} - p_{x1}) \]

Equations \ref{eq:fy1} and \ref{eq:fz1} have the same general form.  Rearranging Equation \ref{eq:fy1} gives:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Fy1decomp}
 F_{y1} =  \dfrac{12EI_z}{l^3(1+\phi_y)} (p_{y2} -p_{y1}) - \dfrac{6EI_z}{l^2(1+\phi_y)}(\theta_{z1} + \theta_{z2}) 
 \end{equation}

The force $F_{y1}$ acting on node 1 is a combination of contributions from bending and shear stiffnesses.  Assuming shear dominance, we can reduce Equation \ref{eq:Fy1decomp} to:
\[ F_{y1} =  \dfrac{12EI_z}{l^3\phi_y} (p_{y2} -p_{y1}) - \dfrac{6EI_z}{l^2\phi_y}(\theta_{z1} + \theta_{z2}) 
\]
\[ F_{y1} =  \dfrac{GA_{sy}}{l} (p_{y2} -p_{y1}) - \dfrac{GA_{sy}}{2}(\theta_{z1} + \theta_{z2}) 
\]

Substituting Equation \ref{eq:kshear} gives:

\[ F_{y1} =  k_{shear_{xy}} (p_{y2} -p_{y1}) - k_{shear_{xy}}l\dfrac{(\theta_{z1} + \theta_{z2})}{2}
\]

\[ F_{y1} =  k_{shear_{xy}} (p_{y2} -p_{y1} - l\theta_{z_{avg}})
\]

Which is a	 small angle approximation of the y-axis spring component of Equation \ref{eq:translationalEqOpp}.\\

We'll account for the bending components of Equation \ref{eq:Fy1decomp} in Section \ref{sec:bendingdominance}.\\

As discussed in Equation \ref{eq:translationalEqOpp}, the translational forces acting on node 1 are equal and opposite those acting on node 2.  This is summed up by Equations \ref{eq:fx2}, \ref{eq:fy2}, and \ref{eq:fz2}.\\

Combining Equations \ref{eq:tz1} and \ref{eq:ktorsion} gives us a small angle approximation to the x-axis rotational spring component of Equation \ref{eq:T1verbose} (in this case the small angle approximation reduces the first term of Equation \ref{eq:T1verbose} to zero, assuming that torques applied to node1 by node 2 have no x component):
\[T_{x1} =  k_{torsion_x}(\theta_{x2} - \theta_{x1}) \]

Equations \ref{eq:ty1} and \ref{eq:tz1} have the same general form.  Rearranging Equation \ref{eq:ty1} gives:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Ty1decomp}
T_{y1} = - \dfrac{6EI_y}{l^2(1+\phi_z)}(p_{z2}- p_{z1}) - \dfrac{EI_y}{l(1+\phi_z)}((4+\phi_z)\theta_{y1}  + (2-\phi_z)\theta_{y2})
\end{equation}

As with Equation \ref{eq:Fy1decomp}, this is a combination of shear and bending effects.  Assuming shearing dominance reduces \ref{eq:Ty1decomp} to:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Ty1decomp2}
T_{y1} = - \dfrac{6EI_y}{l^2\phi_z}(p_{z2}- p_{z1}) - \dfrac{EI_y}{l}(\theta_{y1}  - \theta_{y2})
\end{equation}

\[T_{y1} = - \dfrac{GA_{sz}}{2}(p_{z2}- p_{z1}) + \dfrac{EI_y}{l}(\theta_{y2}  - \theta_{y1})\]

Substituting Equation \ref{eq:kshear} and \ref{eq:kbending} gives:
\[T_{y1} = \dfrac{-l}{2}k_{shear_{xz}}(p_{z2}- p_{z1}) + k_{bending_y}(\theta_{y2}  - \theta_{y1})\]

which is a small angle approximation of the y-axis spring component of \ref{eq:T1verbose} with:
\[ \vec{l}_{rot12} \approx \vec{l}_{nom12} = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc}
-l\\
0\\
0
 \end{array} \right]\]
 
Following this same procedure with Equation \ref{eq:tz1} gives a similar result, but with an extra negative sign:
\[T_{z1} = (-)\dfrac{-l}{2}k_{shear_{xy}}(p_{y2}- p_{y1}) + k_{bending_z}(\theta_{z2}  - \theta_{z1})\]
 
This negative is a byproduct of the crossproduct in Equation \ref{eq:T1verbose}, according to the following unit vector relationships:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:crossUnits}
\hat{x} \times \hat{y} = \hat{z}  \qquad \hat{x} \times \hat{z} = -\hat{y}  
\end{equation}

We'll account for the bending components of Equation \ref{eq:Ty1decomp} in Section \ref{sec:bendingdominance}.\\

Finally, Equation \ref{eq:ty2} and \ref{eq:tz2} have the same general form. Rearranging Equation \ref{eq:ty2} gives:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Ty2Decomp}
T_{y2} =  -\dfrac{6EI_y}{l^2(1+\phi_z)}(p_{z2} - p_{z1}) - \dfrac{EI_y}{l(1+\phi_z)}((2-\phi_z)\theta_{y1}  + (4+\phi_z)\theta_{y2})
\end{equation}

In the case of shearing dominance, \ref{eq:Ty2Decomp} reduces to:
\[  T_{y2} =  -\dfrac{6EI_y}{l^2\phi_z}(p_{z2} - p_{z1}) - \dfrac{EI_y}{l}(\theta_{y2}  - \theta_{y1}) \]

\[  T_{y2} =  \dfrac{GA_{sz}}{2}(p_{z1} - p_{z2}) + \dfrac{EI_y}{l}(\theta_{y1}  - \theta_{y2}) \]

Substituting Equation \ref{eq:kshear} and \ref{eq:kbending} gives:
\[  T_{y2} =  \dfrac{l}{2}k_{shear_{xz}}(p_{z1} - p_{z2}) + k_{bending_y}(\theta_{y1}  - \theta_{y2}) \]

which is a small angle approximation of the y-axis spring component of \ref{eq:T2verbose} with:
\[ \vec{l}_{rot21} \approx \vec{l}_{nom21} = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc}
l\\
0\\
0
 \end{array} \right]\]

Following this same procedure with \ref{eq:tz2}, we get:
\[  T_{z2} =  (-)\dfrac{l}{2}k_{shear_{xy}}(p_{y1} - p_{y2}) + k_{bending_z}(\theta_{z1}  - \theta_{z2}) \]

where again, the extra negative sign is accounted for by the cross product in Equation \ref{eq:T2verbose} and the relationships \ref{eq:crossUnits}.\\

Again, we'll account for the bending components of Equation \ref{eq:Ty2Decomp} in Section \ref{sec:bendingdominance}.\\

Through this process, we have also shown that for shearing dominance, y and z components of torque (Equations \ref{eq:ty1}, \ref{eq:tz1}, \ref{eq:ty2}, \ref{eq:tz2}) of one node are equal and opposite to the other node (Equation \ref{eq:torqueEqOpp}).

%Assuming  bending dominance, we can reduce Equation \ref{eq:Fy1decomp} to:
%\[ F_{y1} =  \dfrac{12EI_z}{l^3} (p_{y2} -p_{y1}) - \dfrac{6EI_z}{l^2}(\theta_{z1} + \theta_{z2})  \]
%\[ F_{y1} =  \dfrac{12EI_z}{l^3} (p_{y2} -p_{y1}) - \dfrac{12EI_z}{l^3}(l\theta_{avg})  \]
%\[ F_{y1} =  \dfrac{12EI_z}{l^3} (p_{y2} -p_{y1} - l\theta_{avg})  \]
%
%Assuming bending dominance, \ref{eq:Ty1decomp} reduces to:
%\[T_{y1} = - \dfrac{6EI_y}{l^2}(p_{z2}- p_{z1}) - \dfrac{2EI_y}{l}(2\theta_{y1}  + \theta_{y2})\]

\subsection{Conclusions}

Compared to Timoshenko's equations, my model has the advantage of not using any small angle approximations.  Since we are modeling flexural joints rather than structural solids, this non-linear treatment of angles is an asset.  Figure \ref{fig:deformationangle} demonstrates the large angular deflections we expect to see in our parts.\\

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{StubbyBeam.png}
  \caption{A diagram of the Timoshenko Beam Element joining two cells in my model.  Due to the low length and relatively high cross sectional area of this ``beam'', I argue that shearing effect dominate bending effects in interactions between cells.}

\subsubsection{Missing Bending Contributions}\label{sec:bendingdominance}

Some bending components of Equations \ref{eq:fy1}, \ref{eq:fz1}, \ref{eq:ty1}, \ref{eq:tz1}, \ref{eq:fy2}, \ref{eq:fz2}, \ref{eq:ty2},  and \ref{eq:tz2} are absent from the model described in Chapter \ref{chap:functionSim}.  Though the model still has a bending stiffness component, it is a special case of the 12DOF Timoshenko Beam Element where shearing dominates bending, and we can safely ignore the extra bending effects in a single cell-cell interaction.  This seems appropriate considering the aspect ratio of the beam that we are using to model the two cells.  As beams become shorter/thicker shearing dominates, and as beams become longer/thinner bending dominates \cite{Bower2009}.  If we are considering a perfectly cubic lattice, the length of the beam element that we can draw between two cells has a length equal to its height and width: the ``beam'' is a cube (Figure \ref{fig:StubbyBeam}).  According to Bower \cite{Bower2009} there is no known accurate approximate theory of short beams.\\

However, I am somewhat concerned about potential effects of the missing bending components from my model and Timoshenko's.  Though these components should not have much an effect on a single interaction between two cells, if we were to form a long thin beam of cube-shaped elements using my model, it's possible that the missing bending elements would stack up to create noticeable deviation from the Timoshenko model.  Looking toward the future development of this model, it would be interesting to try using the complete Timoshenko Beam Element (Equations \ref{eq:fx1} through \ref{eq:tz2}) to model cell-cell interactions to see how the results compare for long, thin beams. My only concern is that as they are written in Equations \ref{eq:fx1} through \ref{eq:tz2}, they have many small angle approximations throughout.  Another option could be to derive a model equivalent to Equations \ref{eq:fx1} through \ref{eq:tz2} without any small angle approximations.\\

That being said, it's also possible that adhering strictly to the Timoshenko model is not the best way to treat this system, especially since we will typically not be creating long, thin beams in practice.  We should also consider the tradeoff between computational efficiency and accuracy - introducing extra bending components will add more floating point operations into each cycle of the simulation.  If the effects of these bending components will rarely be seen, or result in a sufficiently small correction to the model, it might be fine to omit them.  Further development of parts and empirical measurements will help to guide future modeling decisions.

\section{Comparison with VoxCAD Physics Engine}

The model behind VoxCAD uses a special case of the 12DOF Timoshenko Beam Element called the Euler-Bernoulli Beam Element \cite{Hiller2014a}.  The Euler-Bernoulli model assumes no shearing of a beam element joining two cells - it is a bending-dominated form of Timoshenko.  For a beam oriented along the x-axis, using the same Hermitian cubic shape functions, we get the following stiffness matrix for an Euler-Bernoulli beam:

\[ K =  \small {\left[ \begin{smallmatrix}
\tfrac{EA}{l} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \tfrac{-EA}{l} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
 & \tfrac{12EI_z}{l^3} & 0 & 0 & 0 & \tfrac{6EI_z}{l^2} & 0 & \tfrac{-12EI_z}{l^3} & 0 & 0 & 0 & \tfrac{6EI_z}{l^2}\\
 &  & \tfrac{12EI_y}{l^3} & 0 & \tfrac{-6EI_y}{l^2} & 0 & 0 & 0 & \tfrac{-12EI_y}{l^3} & 0 & \tfrac{-6EI_y}{l^2} & 0\\
 &  &  &  \tfrac{GJ}{l} &  0 &  0 &  0 &  0 &  0 & \tfrac{-GJ}{l} & 0 & 0\\
 &  &  &  & \tfrac{4EI_y}{l} & 0 & 0 & 0 & \tfrac{6EI_y}{l^2} & 0 & \tfrac{2EI_y}{l} & 0\\
 &  &  &  &  & \tfrac{4EI_z}{l} & 0 & \tfrac{-6EI_z}{l^2} & 0 & 0 & 0 & \tfrac{2EI_z}{l}\\
 &  &  &  &  &  & \tfrac{EA}{l}  & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
 &  &  &  &  &  &  & \tfrac{12EI_z}{l^3} & 0 & 0 & 0 & \tfrac{-6EI_z}{l^2}\\
 &  &  &  &  &  &  &  & \tfrac{12EI_y}{l^3} & 0 & \tfrac{6EI_y}{l^2}\ & 0\\
 &  & symmetric &  &  &  &  &  &  & \tfrac{GJ}{l} & 0 & 0\\
 &  &  &  &  &  &  &  &  &  & \tfrac{4EI_y}{l} & 0\\
  &  &  &  &  &  &  &  &  &  &  & \tfrac{4EI_z}{l}\\
 \end{smallmatrix} \right] } \]
 
 This is equivalent to the 12DOF Timoshenko stiffness matrix with the shear terms $\phi$ removed.  Multiplying through Equation \ref{eq:forcestiffnessdisp} gives us 12 equations:

\begin{subequations}
\begin{align} 
\label{eq:fx1vox}
F_{x1} &=  -\dfrac{EA}{l}p_{x1} + \dfrac{EA}{l}p_{x2} \\[10pt]
\label{eq:fy1vox}
F_{y1} &=  -\dfrac{12EI_z}{l^3}p_{y1} - \dfrac{6EI_z}{l^2}\theta_{z1} + \dfrac{12EI_z}{l^3}p_{y2} - \dfrac{6EI_z}{l^2}\theta_{z2}\\[10pt]
\label{eq:fz1vox}
F_{z1} &= - \dfrac{12EI_y}{l^3}p_{z1} + \dfrac{6EI_y}{l^2}\theta_{y1} + \dfrac{12EI_y}{l^3}p_{z2} + \dfrac{6EI_y}{l^2}\theta_{y2}\\[10pt]
\label{eq:tx1vox}
T_{x1} &=  -\dfrac{GJ}{l}\theta_{x1} + \dfrac{GJ}{l}\theta_{x2} \\[10pt]
\label{eq:ty1vox}
T_{y1} &= \dfrac{6EI_y}{l^2}p_{z1} - \dfrac{4EI_y}{l}\theta_{y1}  - \dfrac{6EI_y}{l^2}p_{z2} - \dfrac{2EI_y}{l}\theta_{y2} \\[10pt]
\label{eq:tz1vox}
T_{z1} &=  -\dfrac{6EI_z}{l^2}p_{y1} - \dfrac{4EI_z}{l}\theta_{z1}  + \dfrac{6EI_z}{l^2}p_{y2} - \dfrac{2EI_z}{l}\theta_{z2} \\[10pt]
\label{eq:fx2vox}
F_{x2} &=  -F_{x1}\\[10pt]
\label{eq:fy2vox}
F_{y2} &=  -F_{y1}\\[10pt]
\label{eq:fz2vox}
F_{z2} &=  -F_{z1}\\[10pt]
\label{eq:tx2vox}
T_{x2} &=  -T_{x1}\\[10pt]
\label{eq:ty2vox}
T_{y2} &=  \dfrac{6EI_y}{l^2}p_{z1} - \dfrac{2EI_y}{l}\theta_{y1}  - \dfrac{6EI_y}{l^2}p_{z2} - \dfrac{4EI_y}{l}\theta_{y2} \\[10pt]
\label{eq:tz2vox}
T_{z2} &= -\dfrac{6EI_z}{l^2}p_{y1} - \dfrac{2EI_z}{l}\theta_{z1}  + \dfrac{6EI_z}{l^2}p_{y2} - \dfrac{4EI_z}{l}\theta_{z2}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}\\

\subsection{Conclusions}

As I described in Section \ref{sec:bendingdominance}, a bending dominated beam model is more appropriate for long, thin beams.   Given the aspect ratio of the elements being modeled in VoxCAD (very similar to what I've been modeling), the absence of shearing likely causes deflections to be underestimated \cite{Bower2009}.  Additionally, VoxCAD relies on the same small angle approximations present in the Timoshenko model.\\

That being said, my model draws enormous inspiration from VoxCAD, specifically in the handling of composite stiffness and damping constants for multimaterial junctions (Equations \ref{eq:springseries}, \ref{eq:damperseries}), calculation of maximum time step $\Delta t$ (Equations \ref{eq:maxnatFreq} and \ref{eq:maxDeltaT}), and translational actuation model.  Furthermore, seeing the performance that VoxCAD was able to achieve made me more confident to embark on this work in the first place. 

\section{Comparison with COMSOL Simulation}

COMSOL is a professional multiphysics package that uses FEA to solve problems in solid mechanics, optics, analog electronics and more.  I ran a simple passive flexural part model (Figure \ref{fig:somsolsim1}) and an actuated model (Figure \ref{fig:bendSim}) in COMSOL and in AMOEBA to compare their results.\\

I started by using the same geometric representation I'm using in AMOEBA, shown in Figure \ref{fig:somsolsim1}B. Using this minimal geometry, I had trouble decoupling bending and axial stiffness in COMSOL (explained in Section \ref{sec:decoupling}), so I switched to a more geometrically detailed model, shown in Figure \ref{fig:somsolsim1}C.  In the second model, the geometry lowers area moment of inertia ($I$) and causes lower bending stiffness with the same $E$.  In the second simulation I was forced to increase $E$ beyond reason for both my material types to make the simulation work.  I'm still not sure why COMSOL was having so much trouble with this.\\

Additionally in both my COMSOL simulations I could not find an appropriate constraint to fix the angle of the free end of the part, so its face is always oriented normal to the applied force.  Instead I used a roller constraint, which has the added effect of constraining the part to be 9mm wide.  This added extra axial strain to the part as it deforms, which we would not expect to see if the part were in the configuration shown in Figure \ref{fig:deformationangle}.  The dotted line in Figure \ref{fig:somsolsim1}A indicates lateral displacement of the free end of the part from its starting width of 9mm.

  \label{fig:bendSim}
\end{figure}

I ran an additional actuated simulation in COMSOL using its piezoelectric module.  Unfortunately I found it difficult to control the strain of the piezos and couldn't achieve nearly the same strain that I've been modeling in my linear actuator block types.  Still, I found nice qualitative agreement between the COMSOL model and my simulation (Figure \ref{fig:bendSim}). 

\subsection{Conclusions}

Though I was able to run the shear flexure part simulation in AMOEBA without running into instability errors, through the process of doing this I noticed that the stiffnesses I'm using in my simulation are significantly less stiff than the materials we will be modeling in reality.  For example, the elastic modulus of aluminum is 6.9e13Pa.  For a 1x1x1mm cube that's an axial stiffness of 69MN/m, I'm using an axial and shear stiffnesses of 80N/m in the model in Figure \ref{fig:somsolsim1}.  You can see a noticeable amount of shearing occurring from this low stiffness, but stiffnesses approaching anything near 69MN/m will run extremely slow.  I saw the same difference of about 5 orders of magnitude in my bending stiffnesses as well.  I will have to dig into this number more to be sure it's not a scaling error on my part, but it's possible we will have to scale down some of the stiffnesses in our model to help the solver move along.  Because of this difference in scaling (and also previously mentioned roller constraints), it is difficult to do a quantitative analysis, but my modeling does appear to be giving the correct qualitative behavior in the examples shown in Figure \ref{fig:somsolsim1} and \ref{fig:bendSim}.\\

In AMOEBA I represent functional primitives as geometrically simple elements with isotropic and anisotropic material properties deriving from their internal structure.  This way we can discretize the model with a relatively low resolution mesh and increase the efficiency of the simulation.  This is reflected by the number of degrees of freedom solved using each simulation technique (Figure \ref{fig:somsolsim1}); my method resulted in only 162 degrees of freedom for this part, while the full geometrically detailed model required 12315.\\

My model gives a convenient abstraction of degrees of freedom within flexural systems with hooks into low level control over material stiffnesses and other physical properties.  Though it is entirely possible to simulate large assemblies of our functional parts in COMSOL or other multiphysics packages, the time required to setup these models makes them rarely worthwhile.  My tool is bounded by its assumption of voxelized geometry, but in systems for which this voxelization is appropriate, it offers a simple way to compose assemblies of parts in minutes rather than hours.  

\subsubsection{Decoupling Axial/Bending and Shear/Torsion}\label{sec:decoupling}

Axial and bending stiffness typically use the same elastic modulus ($E$) in their formulations (Equations \ref{eq:kaxial} and \ref{eq:kbending}) and are therefore coupled to each other (e.g. you can't pick a value of $E$ that gives low bending stiffness and high axial stiffness at the same time for simple cubic geometry).  However, some composite materials exhibit these behaviors - Calisch showed that it is possible to build a structure that is stiff in axial compression and flexible in bending around one axis from four part types \cite{Calisch2014}.  This DOF coupling applies similarly to shear and torsional stiffness sharing the same shear stiffness $G$ (Equations \ref{eq:kshear} and \ref{eq:ktorsion}).  If we are trying to model a functional primitive that has complex internal geometric structure, we may need to decouple these degrees of freedom.\\

The only way to do this in COMSOL is to derive your own custom stiffness matrix for each of the anisotropic parts you wish to model or explicitly model their anisotropic geometries.  Defining your own stiffness matrix for each of these cell types requires a high degree of technical knowledge from the end user and essentially defeats the purpose of using a professional package; at that point you might as well write your own solver (the situation I'm in).  Building a model of the substructures of each anisotropic cell type requires setting up even more material properties, geometries, and finer meshing of the model - slower from a user perspective and slower computationally.

\section{Performance Metrics}\label{sec:performance}

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{somanycells.png}
  \caption{A 28x28x28 cube containing 21952 cells.}
  \label{fig:somanycells}
\end{figure}

I performed a series of measurements to get a better understanding of where time was being spent during each complete render cycle of the simulation (simulation + threejs rendering).  I performed these tests on assemblies ranging from 1 cell to 21952 cells.  Since the amount of operations per simulation steps is proportional to the number of connections between cells, I ran these tests on cube-shaped assemblies (Figure \ref{fig:somanycells}), so the inner cells are all fully connected to their six neighbors.  This represents a ``worst case scenario'' performance-wise because cells are maximally connected, assemblies we will typically be modeling will not be as dense.  Smaller assemblies have the extra advantage that they have a greater surface area to volume ratio and are therefor proportionally more sparsely connected than larger assemblies of cells, but these effects drop off quickly.\\

I ran these tests using a AMD Radeon HD 6490M graphics card with 160 cores, clocked somewhere between 700-800MHz.  I set the threejs rendering window size to 1200x650px on a 1440x900px monitor and zoomed out so that all blocks were displayed in the rendering window.  Assemblies ranged in size from 1x1x1 to 28x28x28, or 21,952 cells.\\

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Metrics1.png}
  \caption{Render cycle speed shown in ms (top) and in FPS (bottom) for a series of assemblies spanning dimensions 1x1x1 to 28x28x28.  The number of simulation time steps solved per cycle was varied: 50 time steps (green), 100 time steps (navy), and 150 time steps (light blue). Linear fits to top plot shown with dotted lines.}
  \label{fig:Metrics1}
\end{figure}

Each complete render cycle consists of 3 stages: simulation, data transfer, and rendering.  The length of the simulation stage depends on the number of time steps that are being solved in the current render cycle.  Figure \ref{fig:Metrics1} shows plots for 50, 100, and 150 steps per cycle.  The data transfer stage is when the data from the final time step of simulation is pulled off the GPU and onto the CPU.  The rendering stage is when a render call is sent to threejs and graphics are rendered to the screen.

\subsection{Conclusions}

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{simdatatransmetrics.png}
  \caption{Duration of simulation and data transfer stages plotted for 50 time steps (green), 100 time steps (navy), and 150 time steps (light blue). Linear fits plotted with dotted lines.}
  \label{fig:simdatatransmetrics}
\end{figure}

Since I was timing my code in the CPU, my attempts at separately timing the simulation stage and data transfer stage were unreliable.  However, for a given assembly the time required to complete the data transfer stage is not dependent on the number of steps computed in the simulation stage.  So I timed the total length of both stages while varying the number of steps per simulation stage and and plotted it is Figure \ref{fig:simdatatransmetrics}.  I fit a line to these plots and extracted a slope from each line.  From this I was able to determine that the time to solve a single cell's state for one time step on the GPU is approximately 0.2$\mu$s.  I used the following equation:

\[ \text{sim time per cell per } \Delta t = \dfrac{m_{150}-m_{50}}{100} \]

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{simcyclebreakdown.png}
  \caption{A breakdown of a full cycle of simulation (simulation + data transfer + rendering) shows where time was spent.  Time spent in 100 cycles of simulation (salmon), data transfer (blue), and rendering in threejs (purple) are shown in milliseconds.  Time to complete simulation was not measured directly, it was determined from analysis of Figure \ref{fig:simdatatransmetrics}.}
  \label{fig:simcyclebreakdown}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:simcyclebreakdown} shows the breakdown of a complete cycle in terms of time spent in simulation, data transfer, and rendering.  Data transfer takes about 30ms; this could be cut down by updating mesh positions and orientations on the GPU and bypassing data transfer completely.  Rendering speed could be improved greatly by removing invisible internal geometry and merging multiple geometries into a single threejs mesh.  I'm actually computing each interaction between cells twice - once when I process one cell, and again when I process its neighbor.  Since the forces and torques between neighboring cells are symmetric, no new information is gleaned from these extra calculations.  Removing this redundancy will decrease simulation processing time by some factor less than 0.5 depending on the connectivity of the assembly.  These optimizations will come after I'm through the debugging phase of this project.

\section{Final Conclusions}

The model developed in Chapter \ref{chap:functionSim} contains most of the components of the 12DOF Timoshenko beam model, but it is missing some Euler-Bernoulli bending components.  Though the contributions from these components are small for any interaction between two cells, they may result in noticeable accumulated error in long, thin beams formed from functional primitive parts.  Further development of the model could introduce these extra bending terms while still maintaining non-linear handling of angular deformations.  An advantage of my model for simulating flexural joints is its non-linear treatment of angular displacements - allowing for large angular deformations to be simulated without costly remeshing.  Comparison with COMSOL simulation revealed that current material stiffness are far lower than stiffnesses to be used in our proposed system.  In order to maintain efficient solving of the dynamic simulation, we should not increase stiffnesses more than about 1 order of magnitude.  Empirical testing is needed to determine how much of an effect this is having on our simulation results.  As the parts are scaled down and geometric stiffness of our parts decreases, this problem disappears, but at the current scale, we may need to develop methods to overcome this discrepancy.

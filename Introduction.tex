\chapter{Introduction}

An aspirational goal of digital fabrication is the bottom up programmable assembly of meter scale objects with nanometer scale precision.  With this technology, we could design materials with exotic physical properties and radically transform the way we make almost anything.  We believe this is possible by constructing nanoscale assemblers that work together to precisely control and place raw material feedstock.  Though it sounds like science fiction, biology has demonstrated that this is possible; data encoded in DNA can be executed like a computer program to build an immense assortment of molecular-scale machines, which together, coordinate the higher level structure and functions of an organism.%yet proteins display a wide variety of functions and morphologies
\\

Our proposed assembly system relies on a relatively small number of different feedstock and parallelization of assembly.  The material feedstock of the nano-assemblers consists of a finite set of discrete part types, called ``digital materials''.  Digital materials are joined together in a reversible assembly process to produce diverse, functional structures.  Similarly, the protein machinery of biology is made primarily from the same basis set of about 20 amino acids.  Since construction takes place one nano-brick at a time, many assemblers would need to work in parallel to build structures of any significant size.  If the assemblers are designed in such a way that they can be constructed from their own feedstock, assemblers can build more assemblers and the rate of assembly scales exponentially.\\

The nano-assembly I've described will look very different from the way we make things today, and opposes many of the assumptions baked into traditional Computer Aided Design (CAD),  Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM), and robotics design.  Mechanical systems are built with discrete modules of rigid and flexural components, and electronics and controls are distributed spatially across a machine.  Large structures appear to be ``living'' in the sense that their surface is teeming with nano-robots, detecting and correcting errors and performing other functions.  The environment is highly structured, allowing locomotion systems to position themselves globally by counting local movements across a regular lattice.  Machines receive instructions from their environment to coordinate various tasks.%This assembly strategy follows from an existing line of research called ``digital assembly'', where discrete parts are assembled on a regular, periodic lattice.  
\\

This thesis outlines work toward fully integrated, end-to-end software workflows for digital materials that will help us to realize the aspirational future I've just described.  The main contributions include:\\

\textbf{CAD:} a CAD environment for discrete construction that lowers the barriers to designing large, multimaterial assemblies of digital materials.  Hierarchical, parametric controls streamline the process of designing large assemblies of parts.   Abstraction of lattice geometry from its part decomposition simplifies the CAD interface and provides a meaningful underlying representation going into simulation.  CAD workflow is detailed in Chapters \ref{chap:CAD} and \ref{chap:implementation}.\\

\textbf{Simulation:} a dynamic physics engine that leverages the discrete construction of digital materials to simulate their electronic and mechanical behavior with better performance and less user hassle than professional multi-physics software packages.  This simulation tool has been GPU-accelerated so that it performs a dynamic simulation of hundreds of parts in realtime, allowing users to rapidly iterate on their designs.  Simulation methods are detailed in Chapter \ref{chap:functionSim} and evaluated against existing methods and software in Chapter \ref{chap:evaluation}.\\

\textbf{CAM:} a CAM workflow for the current iteration of macro-scale assemblers in development at CBA.  An abstracted machine definition allows a wide diversity of assemblers to be configured through the CAM interface, with hooks for custom g-code generation and machine settings.  The CAM workflow is detailed in Chapter \ref{chap:CAD}.\\

The primary aim of this work is to provide a platform for rapidly exploring the design space around digital materials in a physically realistic way.  The regular, discrete construction of digital assemblies reduces the complexity of design and simulation workflows and increases the computational efficiency of simulating hundreds or thousands of parts at once.  

A side effect of this reduced complexity is that CAD and simulation tools around digital materials require less technical knowledge from the user.  Leveraging this, the work in this thesis also aims to be a kind of ``multiphysics for the masses'' or ``Minecraft with physics'': a multiphysics sandbox that even a child can understand and operate.  \\

The CAD/simulation tool I've built follows from a long line of virtual construction environments and simulators where early explorations in distributed machine design and self-replication were first performed.  Many of these virtual environments have since been opened up to a larger, global community of researchers and enthusiasts for experimentation.  This work will inform future trajectories in CBA research and in the broader field of programmable materials, modular robotics, and digital fabrication.  In the fullness of time, I hope that it will grow into a platform for exploring self-assembling systems based on the foundations of engineering and materials science rather than biology.

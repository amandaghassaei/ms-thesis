abstract = {Atomically precise technologies (APT) hold the potential to meet many of the greatest global challenges, bringing revolutions in science, medicine, energy, and industry. This technology roadmap points the way for strategic research initiatives to deliver on this promise. The long-term vision of all nanotechnologists has been the fabrication of a wider range of materials and products with atomic precision. However, experts in the field have had strong differences of opinion on how rapidly this will occur. It is uncontroversial that expanding the scope of atomic precision will dramatically improve high-performance technologies of all kinds, from medicine, sensors, and displays to materials and solar power. Holding to Moore's law demands it, probably in the next 15 years or less. Atomically precise manufacturing processes use a controlled sequence of operations to build structures with atomic precision. Scanning probe devices achieve this on crystal surfaces. Biomolecular machines achieve this in living systems. In both technology and nature, the components of compley atomically precise systems are made using APM processes. Recently identified approaches for using products of today's APM to organize and exploit other functional nanoscale components show great promise. Building on achievements in other areas of nanotechnology, they point to capabilities that could prove tranformative in multiple fields, expanding the set of nanoscale building blocks and architectures for products.},

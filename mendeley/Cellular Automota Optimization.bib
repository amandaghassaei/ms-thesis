@article{Gosper1984,
abstract = {We informally describe a computer algorithm for simulating deterministic cellular automata. It grows “smarter” by selectively recording intermediate computations while operating on a compressed representation of the cellular space-time. No information is lost because configurations do not actually evolve. Instead, the simulator accomodates random exploration of place-times in the future of initial configurations embedded in an effectively unbounded void. We use Conway's Life automaton as a model, but the idea extends easily to other geometries, dimensions, and number of states.},
